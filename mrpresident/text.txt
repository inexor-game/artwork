Our team is in deep trouble
We don't win anymore
I am officially running to the enemy flag
We need to build a wall, and it has to built quickly
Good job! You're fired!
Our teammates are stupid! We have stupid teammates!
I think I am a nice person!
Enemy people are coming into this base illegally!
I hate you, I really do!
Look I am the best teammate; people used to call me up and say "you're the best".
I don't mind having stupid teammates but I have stupid teammates!
Our leaders are stupid!
Oh you almost got him, great job!
I have the highest death per kill.. kill per death ratio in the history of.. ratio
I am the best! Look at the statistics it says: "hes the best". Me yes you no!
Make this team better again!
If it weren't for me, you wouldn't be even talking about defending the base!
